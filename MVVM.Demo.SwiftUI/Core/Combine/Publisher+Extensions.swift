extension Publisher {
  /// Republishes elements received from a publisher, by assigning them to a property marked as a publisher, but does not hold a strong reference to the assigned property.
  ///
  /// Use this operator when you want to receive elements from a publisher and republish them through a property marked with the `@Published` attribute. The `assign(to:)` operator manages the life cycle of the subscription, canceling the subscription automatically when the ``Published`` instance deinitializes. Because of this, the `assign(to:)` operator doesn't return an ``AnyCancellable`` that you're responsible for like ``assign(to:on:)`` does.
  ///
  /// The example below shows a model class that receives elements from an internal <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Foundation/Timer/TimerPublisher>, and assigns them to a `@Published` property called `lastUpdated`. Because the `to` parameter has the `inout` keyword, you need to use the `&` operator when calling this method.
  ///
  ///     class MyModel: ObservableObject {
  ///         @Published var lastUpdated: Date = Date()
  ///         init() {
  ///              Timer.publish(every: 1.0, on: .main, in: .common)
  ///                  .autoconnect()
  ///                  .assign(to: &$lastUpdated)
  ///         }
  ///     }
  ///
  /// If you instead implemented `MyModel` with `assign(to: lastUpdated, on: self)`, storing the returned ``AnyCancellable`` instance could cause a reference cycle, because the ``Subscribers/Assign`` subscriber would hold a strong reference to `self`. Using `assign(to:)` solves this problem.
  ///
  /// While the `to` parameter uses the `inout` keyword, this method doesn't replace a reference type passed to it. Instead, this notation indicates that the operator may modify members of the assigned object, as seen in the following example:
  ///
  ///         class MyModel2: ObservableObject {
  ///             @Published var id: Int = 0
  ///         }
  ///         let model2 = MyModel2()
  ///         Just(100).assign(to: &model2.$id)
  ///
  /// - Parameter published: A property marked with the `@Published` attribute, which receives and republishes all elements received from the upstream publisher.

  }
  
  /// Attaches a subscriber with closure-based behavior.
  ///
  /// Use ``Publisher/sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)`` to observe values received by the publisher and process them using a closure you specify.
  ///
  /// In this example, a <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Range> publisher publishes integers to a ``Publisher/sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)`` operator’s `receiveValue` closure that prints them to the console. Upon completion the ``Publisher/sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)`` operator’s `receiveCompletion` closure indicates the successful termination of the stream.
  ///
  ///     let myRange = (0...3)
  ///     cancellable = myRange.publisher
  ///         .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },

  ///     //  value: 1
  ///     //  value: 2
  ///     //  value: 3
  ///     //  completion: finished
  ///

  /// The return value should be held, otherwise the stream will be canceled.
  ///
  /// - parameter receiveComplete: The closure to execute on completion.
  /// - parameter receiveValue: The closure to execute on receipt of a value.
